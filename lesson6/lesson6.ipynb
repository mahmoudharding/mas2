According to the <code>tips</code> dataset documentation, the <code>tips</code> dataset is a data frame with 244 rows and 7 variables which represents some tipping data where one waiter recorded information about each tip he received over a period of a few months working in one restaurant. In all the waiter recorded 244 tips. The data was reported in a collection of case studies for business statistics <a href = \"https://sebastiansauer.github.io/data/tips-help.pdf\">(Bryant & Smith 1995)</a>.
